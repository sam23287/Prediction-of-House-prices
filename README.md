Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad.
But this dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes, this project is about predicting the final price of each home.

Goal:
To predict the sales price for each house.
Note: This project, part of a Kaggle competition, involved submitting predictions on a test set to Kaggle's official website.
